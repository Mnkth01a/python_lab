# my first python code

# i get how simple it is, and i should be more advanced than this, but this is for learning the syntax, building experience using vs code, and making sure i understand how the output performs.

print("Hello Cruel World!\n"); # this causes an additional line between this print and the next. print() prints on a new line by default?  Or is something else happening here?

print("I'm still here!");

# let's test it. this printed on a new line.
print("Well, whadda you know.!?");

# What about this?
print("Will it be on a new line?"); print("Here's your answer.");

# let's try concatenation. (i spell better than i pronounce.) works as advertised!
print("Here's part one: " + "and here's part two.");

# So, these are good examples of how simple print() commands work in python.
